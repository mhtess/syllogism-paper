## RSA Models

This folder contains 9 versions of the RSA model published in the paper. The three `M0` models are the ones reported in the main text (Literal Speaker, State Communication, Belief Alignment). The `M1` and `M2` models include a pragmatic interpretation component, where the premises of the syllogisms are interpreted pragmatically as coming from a rational speaker. The `M1` models define the speaker utility with respect to the state (Venn diagram). The `M2` models define the speaker utility with respect to a QUD, which is assumed to include the regions of the state that refer to the A and C properties (the conclusion of the syllogism). The `M2` models are discussed in the Appendix of the paper.


- `M00_LIT_LIT`: *Literal Speaker* -- Literal interpretation, literal production
- `M01_LIT_PRAG_BELIEF`: *Belief Alignment* -- Literal interpretation, pragmatic production (KL utility)
- `M02_LIT_PRAG_STATE`: *State Communication* -- Literal interpretation, pragmatic production (state surprisal utility)
- `M10_PRAG_STATE_LIT`: Pragmatic interpretation (state), literal production
- `M11_PRAG_STATE_PRAG_BELIEF`: Pragmatic interpretation (state), pragmatic production (KL utility)
- `M12_PRAG_STATE_PRAG_STATE`: Pragmatic interpretation (state), pragmatic production (state surprisal utility)
- `M20_PRAG_QUD_LIT`: Pragmatic interpretation (QUD), literal production
- `M21_PRAG_QUD_PRAG_BELIEF`: Pragmatic interpretation (QUD), pragmatic production (KL utility)
- `M22_PRAG_QUD_PRAG_STATE`: Pragmatic interpretation (QUD), pragmatic production (state surprisal utility)

The `M0_LIT.wppl` contains only the literal interpretation component of the model, which produces a distribution on states given a syllogism (Fig. 5 in paper).
